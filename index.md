## About Me

I’m an adaptable and analytical professional with a background that spans research, R&D, team leadership, and visual effects. Throughout my career, I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of creativity and technology, whether building VFX pipelines or exploring how AI can reshape how we learn.

I’m currently completing a master’s degree, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=VrZ7PZMAAAAJ&hl=nl" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Igor Mayer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasper-geeroms-01258259/?originalSubdomain=be" target="_blank">Msc. Kasper Geeroms</a>, where I’m researching how gamified language apps and GPT-powered AI tutors can support learners towards the advanced level. My focus is on identifying strategies that help people break through the intermediate plateau, a challenge I’ve experienced myself as a Japanese learner. It’s deeply rewarding to combine academic research with real-world user needs, and to contribute something meaningful to the field of educational technology.

At the heart of my work are a few core values: open and empowering communication, transparency, and reliability. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and helping teams solve complex problems, especially when it means leveraging data, AI, or machine learning in thoughtful, innovative ways.

Whether I'm developing tools that improve workflows or analyzing systems for smarter decision-making, I bring an eye for detail and a drive to make things better.
